# SciPy Metadata Analysis
This repository extracts metadata information from scientifc papers throughout scientific databases and analyses them with pandas

# How To Implement



# Goal
This repository provides Python3 classes to scrap meta data information from scientific papers.
provide a scientific meta data analysis over papers published and accessable via their scientific database website, like Sciencesaved sources in my booksmarks. For Goals, you might read the section [Origins of the Idea](#Origins-of-the-Idea).

# Origins of the Idea
My Bachelorthesis needed an meta data-analysis over all the relevant papers that i have found in online databases such as `Science Direct`, `IEEE` and `Springer Online`.
Since I already know the Pandas library for Python3, I wanted to gather the data as automatically as possible. Furthermore I was able to expand my knowledge in the field of webscrapping with `Selenium`.

# To implement
- [X] ScienceDirect Integration
    - [X] Author names
    - [X] Paper Title
    - [X] DOI
    - [X] Keywords
    - [X] Publication Date
    - [X] Journalname
    - [X] Journal Impact Factor
    - [X] Amount of Citations


# Lessons Learned
1. Improved my skills in Webscrapping with `Selenium`.
2. `Beautiful Soup` is not suitable for dynamic (JavaScript generated) webpage content
