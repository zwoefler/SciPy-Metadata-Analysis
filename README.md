# Origins of the Idea
For my Bachelorthesis, I needed a way to analyze Meta-Data of scientific papers that i found online in databases such as `Science Direct`, `IEEE` and `Springer Online`. I went through a lot of this databases and found probably relevant papers. However, for the dataanalysis part, I didn't want to copy all Journal Names, Authors, DOI, Impact Factor, Receive-, Revise- and Acceptance Date, and so on into an excel sheet. Since I had already gatherd more than 150 papers, this could have been a very anoying task.
